The Rectangle class allows you to create and manipulate rectangles with specified width and height. It provides methods for setting dimensions, calculating area, perimeter, diagonal, and generating a visual representation.

The Square class is a subclass of Rectangle, specializing in squares. When a Square object is created, it automatically sets both width and height to the same value, maintaining its square properties. The class also includes methods to set the side length and offers a clear string representation.
